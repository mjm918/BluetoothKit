# BluetoothKit

I am using this module in 2 of my Apps. I find it reliable and easy.

# Installation

`allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}`

`dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.mjm918:BluetoothKit:1.0.1'
	}`



Highly inspired by some other libraries. Trying to make a better one.. contribute
