# BluetoothKit

Now working as a module. Later I will upload a library via jitpack

#TODO: 
publish on jitpack

`implementation 'com.github.mjm918:BluetoothKit:1.0.1'`

^ this one `implementation` might not work now





Highly inspired by some other libraries. Trying to make a better one.. contribute
